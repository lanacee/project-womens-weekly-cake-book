# Basic Shopping Cart (React) + MongoDB Capstone Project
 
## Project scenario 
 
Our client wants a basic web application where you can select and buy their shirts. They require a shopping cart to be displayed, where it shows the contents of the chosen shirts and their cost. It will also add a tax of 10% on top of the total and then $20 for the shipping cost. The actual purchasing of the items does not need to be implemented, but in some way, a visual button that would be selected could implement to purchase in a later development cycle.

Please follow the following guidelines: 
 
-	You are to build a website using REACT
-	You are to create and connect to a MongoDB Database
-	You are to use the contents with BSC.zip which will give you the files you need to use within your application. 
-	Make a user-friendly landing page that allows the user to do the following:
-	Add and Remove selected shirts from the shopping cart
-	Adds the item's value with the tax and shipping costs once selected to the shopping cart
-	A button to remove all items from the shopping cart


# The Australian Women's Weekly Children's Birthday Cake Book 

Instead of tshirts, I've chosen to use cakes from the cult classic Australian Women's Weekly Children's Birthday Cake for my shopping cart project.

The book has sold over a million copies since being published in 1980 and even has it's own [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian_Women%27s_Weekly_Children%27s_Birthday_Cake_Book).


The 'duck cake' recently returned to fame after featuring in an episode of the popular Australian animated television series Bluey.

# User story

As a person without enough time or expertise to bake one of the Australian Women's Weekly Children's Birthday Cakes, I want to buy one of these cakes so that I can bring it to a birthday party and everyone can enjoy it.
